# arnexyz

*arnexyz* is a WordPress theme for my personal blog *[arne.xyz](https://arne.xyz/)*.
This theme is based on my boilerplate theme for WordPress, [wp-blank](https://github.com/akamola/wp-blank), with a lot of customizations focusing on blogging and *indie web*/*open web*/*semantic web* extensions.

**Note**: This theme is *delivered in beta*. There might be some rough edges left or leftovers of experiments that may backfire. I'll try to keep the code as clean as possible and document everything, but maybe something slipped through.
Feel free to report and open an issue on GitHub.

## Features

- Page template for an archive overview featuring a search bar, tag cloud, category list with RSS feeds, post format list, and—with the plugin [Compact Archives](https://wordpress.org/plugins/compact-archives/) installed—a year/month calendar view.
- Custom post status for "retired" posts that one wants to keep but not to be accessible in the frontend.
- This theme participates in the [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io) on April 9th and only shows the good old HTML.
- Custom editor styles for a little look-n-feel of the [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

## Credit Where Credit Is Due
